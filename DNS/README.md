# DNS Demo

## Introduction
This directory contains a set of applications serving as demonstration of DNS querying via the [dnspython](https://pypi.org/project/dnspython) module. 3rd party dependencies which must be installed are listed in the [reuirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file. All applications are self-documented concerning the command line arguments. In other words, if you start any of the applications with the `-h` or `--help` switch, you will get instructions how to start the application.
