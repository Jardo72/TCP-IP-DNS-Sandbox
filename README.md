# TCP/IP & DNS Sandbox

## Introduction
Set of demo/experimental applications for demonstration of TCP/IP and DNS implemented in Python. The project involves several subfolders which are briefly described in a subsequent section of this document. Each subdirectory has its own requirements.txt file defining the dependencies (PyPI modules) required by the application(s) present in the subdirectory. Each subdirectory has also its own README.md file, which provides more details about the application(s) present in the subdirectory.

## Demo Applications
